\section{Results}
In the end we created a simulation of the solar system where you can see the planets move in real time. 
In this simulation you can move around and watch the planets move in real time. As the planets are moving quite slow in real time we include a time skip function, meaning you can speed up the time to have the planets move around the sun in a noticeable pace. 
It clearly visible that the planets are moving around the sun according to the laws of gravity.
In order to visualize the system, you can send comets flying which will follow the gravitational pull of the planets and change its trajectory accordingly.
